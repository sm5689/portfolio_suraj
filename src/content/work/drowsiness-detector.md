### Project Overview
Addressed the critical issue of driver fatigue with a non-intrusive monitoring system. The application uses a webcam feed to analyze facial cues and determine alert levels without requiring specialized hardware.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Prioritized low-latency inference for immediate alerts.
- **Techniques**: Utilized facial landmark detection and machine learning techniques.
- **Accuracy**: Tuned for high accuracy to ensure driver safety.
