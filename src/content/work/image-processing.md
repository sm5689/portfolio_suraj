### Key Features
- **Concurrent Processing**: Architected a multi-threaded system supporting 100+ concurrent operations across JPG, PNG, and PPM formats.
- **Design Patterns**: Applied 7 object-oriented design patterns (Adapter, Facade, Builder, Command, Decorator, Strategy, Visitor), reducing cyclomatic complexity by 35%.
- **Optimization**: Optimized processing pipelines to reduce average execution time by 20% (500ms to 400ms per image).
- **Architecture**: Implemented a clean MVC architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
